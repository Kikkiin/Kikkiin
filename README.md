# About Me

👋 Hi, I’m @Kikkiin,
 - A UX/UI girl with a background in front-end development. I enjoy designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces and exploring how small design choices impact the user experience. My main tool is Figma, where I focus on wireframing, prototyping, and iterating on designs.

💡 I find front-end development both exciting and challenging – I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which helps me bring my designs to life, but I enjoy working on the design process the most, focusing on user experience and visual storytelling.
  
👀 I’m very interested in learning new things! 

🌍 In my free time, I enjoy good food, fine wine, and traveling as much as I can.

🎨 I’m currently working on improving my skills in UX research and interaction design, and I’m always open to learning more about usability and accessibility in digital products.

🌱 Educated at Noroff.

💼 My background in nursing has given me unique perspectives on the importance of clear communication and empathy, invaluable in the development process.

📫 Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss UX, design, or just have a chat about creative processes!
