# About Me

👋 Hi, I’m @Kikkiin,
  - an aspiring front-end developer based in Oslo, passionate about creating intuitive and appealing web applications. After a career in nursing, I found my calling in the world of       technology, where I combine my caring nature with a love for coding.
  
👀 I’m very interested in learning new things! 

🌍 In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, love to eat good food and drink fine wine, being outdoors in nature, and I spend all my money on traveling as much as I can around this earth.

🌱 Educated at Noroff, I am dedicated to continuous learning and improvement. I am fascinated by interaction design and user experience, striving to create solutions that are visually     appealing and easy to use. I’m currently learning about css, html and javascript.

💼 My background in nursing has given me unique perspectives on the importance of clear communication and empathy, invaluable in the development process.

📚 Technologies I work with include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with plans to soon delve into modern frameworks to further expand my skills.

🤝 I am always open to collaborations and new projects.

📫 Feel free to reach out for collaborations, mentorship, or just a friendly chat about everything from front-end development to life's big questions.
